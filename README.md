# Terminator 2, Easy Money Hack

Terminator 2 is my all time favorite Sci-Fi movie and probably the best sequel ever made... T2 or Aliens... Both by genius director James Cameron.
One of the scenes that I personally love is the "Easy Money" scene. It really shows the essence of what young John Connor is; smart, crafty, streetwise and he doesn't take authority serious. All the trademarks of a great rebel leader.

## ATARI Portfolio
Since I procured an Atari Portfolio and a parallel part for it, I figured what can I do with this???
Well... why not recreate the PIN hack program?

So I wrote a program that can run on an Portfolio and looks like this.

## Uploading
You will need to upload the PIN.EXE using the FT.COM from a machine that runs DOS and that has a parallel port.
Your Portfolio needs the parallel interface.
You will connect the PC to your Portfolio using a parallel "nul modem" cable.

Then you will need to grow a long strand of hair and grow an attitude and you'll be ready to role play John Connor.
