## Uploading
You will need to upload the PIN.EXE using the FT.COM from a machine that runs DOS and that has a parallel port.
Your Portfolio needs the parallel interface.
You will connect the PC to your Portfolio using a parallel "nul modem" cable.

Then you will need to grow a long strand of hair and grow an attitude and you'll be ready to role play John Connor.
